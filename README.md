# e2Bay

This project is a React e-commerce application built with Typescript and leverages best practices for modern web development.

Key Features
Frontend: React with Typescript for a structured and maintainable codebase.
Data Management:
Products: Simulated using json-server for easy data manipulation and prototyping. Can be replaced with a real backend solution in production.
Users: Simulated using json-server for user authentication. Can be integrated with a real authentication service later.
Payments: Integrates with PayPal for secure payment processing.
Data Fetching: Utilizes React Query for efficient data fetching and caching, avoiding unnecessary useEffects.
Getting Started
Prerequisites:
Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system.
Clone the Repository:
Bash
git clone https://your-repository-url.git
Usa el código con precaución.
Install Dependencies:
Bash
cd your-project-directory
npm install (or yarn install)
Usa el código con precaución.
Run Development Server:
Bash
npm start (or yarn start)
Usa el código con precaución.
This will start the development server, usually accessible at http://localhost:3000 by default.
Project Structure
The project follows a common React application structure:

src/: Contains the application source code.
components/: Reusable UI components.
pages/: Application pages and routes.
services/: Data fetching and manipulation logic (utilizing React Query).
types/: TypeScript type definitions.
App.tsx: Main application entry point.
public/: Stores static assets like images and fonts.
package.json: Manages dependencies and scripts.
Data Management
Products:
Simulated product data is stored in db/products.json.
You can modify or extend the product data structure within this file.
Users:
Simulated user data is stored in db/users.json.
This is a placeholder for a real authentication system in production.
Payment Integration
PayPal integration is implemented for secure online payments.
You will need to set up a PayPal developer account and configure the credentials accordingly.
Best Practices
React Query: This project leverages React Query for efficient data fetching and caching, reducing the need for manual useEffects management.
Typescript: Enhances code maintainability and reduces runtime errors with type safety.
Next Steps
Customize the product data structure and design in db/products.json.
Implement a real backend solution to replace the simulated data.
Integrate a proper user authentication system.
Style the application using your preferred CSS framework.
This readme provides a starting point for your e-commerce project. Feel free to explore the codebase, customize features, and extend functionalities to create a full-fledged online store.
